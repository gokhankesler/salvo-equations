# salvo-equations
This study includes a demonstration of naval salvo fire models created mathematically by Hughes (1995) and Armstrong (2005) in the simulation environment using Design of Experiments techniques. Analysis of the simulated outputs will reveal relationships between parameters and statistical methods will compensate for the drawbacks of the model.
