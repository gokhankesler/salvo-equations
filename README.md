In 1995, retired U.S. Navy Captain Wayne Hughes formulated a salvo model for
assessing the military worth of warship capabilities in the missile age. His model suggests
that modern naval surface warfare can have regions of instability and that numerical
superiority provides a consistent advantage. However, Hughes’ model is deterministic
and provides no information about the distribution of outcomes that can result from an
inherently stochastic salvo exchange. In 2005, Michael Armstrong added random
variables to Hughes’ model and created a stochastic salvo model. By using mathematical
approximations, Armstrong provides closed-form solutions for some stochastic outcomes.
This thesis examines the two salvo models using data farming. That is, sophisticated
designs of experiments are used to evaluate the models at thousands of input
combinations. For each model, responses such as ship losses, proportional ship losses,
and fractional exchange ratio (FER) are reformulated as readily interpretable regression
and partition tree metamodels of the model’s inputs. For the stochastic salvo model, this
is also done for the probability that one side wins. The metamodel fits are outstanding,
generally explaining over 97 percent of the variance of the experimental results. The data
farming results reinforce Hughes’ basic findings.
